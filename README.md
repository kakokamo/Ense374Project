# Project Description

The SK Trails project aims to create an intuitive platform for both novice and experienced hikers to discover suitable hiking trails based on their preferences and skill levels. Platform can provide users with various amounts of hiking trails in Saskatchewan, which will enhance user engagement by offering detailed information about the duration, length, terrain, difficulty and user reviews of the trails. Our goal is to enhance the overall hiking experience by providing personalized recommendations, helping users make informed decisions that align with their fitness level, interests, and outdoor goals. This will promote outdoor activity, environmental awareness, and healthier lifestyles for people within the region.
